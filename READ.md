# File Organizer (With Logging & Error Handling)

This is an improved version of the file organizer script. It organizes your files **and** includes detailed logging and error handling for robustness.

## ✅ Features

- Organizes files into folders by type (`Images`, `Documents`, etc.)
- Adds logging:
  - All moved files are logged
  - Errors are captured in a log file
- Error handling prevents crashes if something goes wrong

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Scans a folder for files
2. Matches extensions to predefined types
3. Moves each file into the corresponding folder
4. If a file doesn't match any known type, it goes to `Others`
5. Logs all actions to `file_organizer.log`

## 🗂️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries
